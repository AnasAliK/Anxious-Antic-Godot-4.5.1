# **Anxious Antic – Game Design Document**

---

## **1. High Concept**

A fast-paced, humorous micro-game where the player helps a socially anxious character navigate public situations. Each level lasts **20 seconds**, during which the player must identify and neutralize social threats (like someone taking a photo or approaching to talk) before the character panics. The game is quick, chaotic, and funny—every second counts.

---

## **2. Gameplay Overview**

### **2.1 Core Loop**

1. Player sees the anxious character in a public scenario.
2. A “social threat” (NPC action) appears.
3. Player must identify and interact with the threat before the 20-second timer ends.
4. **Success:** Character relieved → level complete.
5. **Failure:** Threat completes action → comedic panic reaction.

**Core Mechanic:** Quick point-and-click/tap interaction.

---

### **2.2 Controls**

* **Mouse:** Click on NPC/object to stop threat
* **Keyboard (optional):** Arrow keys move selection cursor
* **UI Buttons:** Optional “Retry” and “Next Level”

---

### **2.3 Win / Lose Conditions**

**Win:** Interact with the correct NPC/object before time ends.
**Lose:** Timer hits zero, or the threat completes its action.

**Feedback:**

* **Success:** Calm animation, relief
* **Failure:** Exaggerated panic (sweat, flinch, jump)
